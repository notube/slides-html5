       <div class='large'>NoTube is a project about the Web and TV. WP7c focused on 
social media and TV, a topic that has become more popular in the lifetime of the 
project.<br /><br />

Early on we identified some <a href="">key user questions</a> and some associated <a 
href="">technological questions</a>. We chose a <a href="">strategy</a>, some <a 
href="">techniques</a>, and specific <a href="">applications</a> to explore these 
questions. Here we present a summary, including the results of <a href="">user 
testing</a> the N-Screen application and some notes on <a href="">continuity and 
longevity</a>.</div>

      <h1>Background: TV, the Web, and Attention</h1>

      <img src="content/images/cat_tv.png" width="200px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">
        There is increasing competition for attention from the Web, and TV is losing out.</li>
        <br /><em>But</em> activity data, personal data and social network data mean fewer eyeballs but more
valuable ones
        <br />
        We took a user perspective on these changes, rather than an industry one.

      </div>

<div class="notes">
Driving our work are some observations about behaviour and technology. The Web has 
been a looming presence over TV since it began to take up large proportions of 
peoples' attention. Competition for attention: for adverts, for types of content, for 
free over paid for content, and the sheer volume of content, are all reducing the 
amount of attention devoted to traditional TV.
<br />
<br />
However, by measuring and classifying usage more precisely, the technology could 
improve the quality of the attention TV does receive. The increased availability of 
activity data, personal data and social network data are all valuable resources of 
increasing the monetary value of the attention that is given: fewer eyeballs but more 
valuable ones.

     <h1>Key User Questions</h1>

      <div class="large">
General questions such as: how do people watch TV together, and why? How is this 
changing as the devices and availability of programmes change and with the rise of 
social networks? what are the technologies that might help them watch together in the 
way they want to, in the future?
      </div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>And Specifically</h1>
      <div class="large">

How people can find something to watch when faced with an overwhelming choice? what 
is the role of social recommendations to end users? what are the perceived trade-offs 
between personalisation in exchange for loss of privacy, and how is it best to interact 
with the Web and TV simultaneously?

      </div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Key Technical Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Metadata: what's the role of metadata in TV and in applications?</li>
<li>Device pairing: how do devices find out about each other, and how can we make the process very simple?</li>
<li>Synchronisation: what are good technologies for syncing TV and other metadata, and sharing information in real time?</li>
</lu>

      <h1>Projects Face Choices</h1>
      <div class="large">
 ...modest role in something huge - or a huge role in something modest?
<br />
NoTube's approach was to use our own modest work to start conversations that allowed us to help shape some huge changes

      <h1>Strategy</h1>
<uL>
<li>Be visible</li>
<li>Be adaptable</li>

      <h1>Techniques</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use standards</li>
<li>Use open source software; reuse software where possible</li>
<li>Use web technologies for speed of prototyping</li>

      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">
People want to watch TV together. They like talking about TV - they like people having watched the same thing as them, and older ones miss the days when people were much more likely to have watched something they had. They don't have to watch it at the same time as others but sometimes this is fun.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">

People like recommendations from friends, either personally or via social networks: 
social networks here are an extension of face to face interactions; but not all 
recommendations from friends are equally good. People will trade-off privacy and 
personalisation, especially if they see the benefit. They're getting used to systems 
that do this, like Amazon. 



      </div>
    </section>
    <section>

      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">
People use various means to find out what to watch, 
including social networks and word of mouth, newspapers and listings magazines, and 
TV adverts and TV show cross-promotion.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">
As TVs become more complex, interacting with them via remotes is becoming much harder, in particular, UX between applications is inconsistent, text input is difficult, and reading text is difficult. There are no conventions for tablets as first screen controls, so their behaviour is not well understood, although in general people enjoy using tablets and find them intuitive.
      </div>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: Technical Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">
Probably the key issue is pairing of devices. We have tried various techniques: QR codes, numeric codes, autodiscovery, and numeric 'pin' encapsulating enough information to connect seems to be most useful, simple and best understood and least prone to technical problems.
