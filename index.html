       <div class='large'>NoTube is a project about the Web and TV. WP7c focused on 
social media and TV, a topic that has become more popular in the lifetime of the 
project.<br /><br />

Early on we identified some <a href="">key user questions</a> and some associated <a 
href="">technological questions</a>. We chose a <a href="">strategy</a>, some <a 
href="">techniques</a>, and specific <a href="">applications</a> to explore these 
questions. Here we present a summary, including the results of <a href="">user 
testing</a> the N-Screen application and some notes on <a href="">continuity and 
longevity</a>.</div>

      <h1>Background: TV, the Web, and Attention</h1>

      <img src="content/images/cat_tv.png" width="200px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">
        There is increasing competition for attention from the Web, and TV is losing out.</li>

        <br /><em>But</em> access to activity data, personal data and social network 
data potentially mean the viewers TV does get are more valuable
        <br />

        We took a user perspective on these changes, rather than an industry one.

      </div>

<div class="notes">
Driving our work are some observations about behaviour and technology. The Web has 
been a looming presence over TV since it began to take up large proportions of 
peoples' attention. Competition for attention: for adverts, for types of content, for 
free over paid for content, and the sheer volume of content, are all reducing the 
amount of attention devoted to traditional TV.
<br />
<br />
However, by measuring and classifying usage more precisely, the technology could 
improve the quality of the attention TV does receive. The increased availability of 
activity data, personal data and social network data are all valuable resources of 
increasing the monetary value of the attention that is given: fewer eyeballs but more 
valuable ones.

     <h1>Key User Questions</h1>

      <div class="large">
General questions such as: how do people watch TV together, and why? How is this 
changing as the devices and availability of programmes change and with the rise of 
social networks? What are the technologies that might help them watch together in the 
way they want to, in the future?
      </div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>And Specifically</h1>
      <div class="large">

How people can find something to watch when faced with an overwhelming choice? What 
is the role of social recommendations to end users? What are the perceived trade-offs 
between personalisation in exchange for loss of privacy? How is it best to interact 
with the Web and TV simultaneously?

      <h1>N-Screen functionality and User Testing</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen0.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">
N-Screen started out as a technology demonstrator – so the UI developed organically – started out as a proof of concept.

We created a more polished, professional visual interface in time for IBC.

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>User Scenario</h1>
      <img src="content/images/scenario.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

A small group of people together in the same room, each with their own personal 
device, deciding what to watch together on one shared TV.

Alternatively the people in the group could be physically remote.
<br />
In either case, the specific scenario is about choosing and watching in 
real-time with others.


      </div>
    </section>



    <section>
      <h1>Finding 'Something to watch'</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen1.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

N-Screen supports different recommendation and browsing strategies, including those 
based on Beancounter profiles, within one unified end-user interface. 

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Second screen</h1>
<!--      <img src="content/images/tv1.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>-->
      <div class="large">

N-Screen's 'Connected TV' is a web page capable of playing streaming and on-demand 
HTML and flash video. You connect to a specific TV via a pin number. Multiple TVs can 
play the same content simultaneously.

      </div>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>Suggestions for you</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen2.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

Each participant starts with a different set of personalised recommendations from one 
or more video collections (based on Beancounter).

Our user testing participants all liked the concept of seeing programme suggestions 
based on things they’d done in the past.

      </div>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>'Random Selection' (Shuffle)</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen3.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

An alternative means of surfacing content buried in the 
video collection, or for times when the user might reach a dead-end with the 
recommendations approach. It also adds an extra element of serendipity to the 
experience. It was liked by testers.


      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Drag and drop real-time sharing</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen4.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

Finding interesting niche video content and sharing these ‘hidden gems’ with friends 
are both central components of N-Screen. This aspect of the UX really appealed to people because it’s 
simple and fun to use. But they were less convinced about real-time sharing.

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Getting recommendations from friends</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen3.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

Receiving suggestions from friends is another way of finding something interesting to watch.
The idea of sharing and receiving suggestions for things to watch with friends in this way was a highlight of the app for many. 

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>More information about a programme</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen7.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

Tapping on a programme suggestion in N-Screen displays an overlay with a brief 
programme synopsis, and a 'linked data' explanation as to why it has been recommended.

Contrary to our expectations, people didn't care much about explanations.

      </div>
    </section>



    <section>
      <h1>Changing the TV using drag and drop</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen6.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">
Once the group has decided what to watch, one of the participants drags the programme to the TV icon.
People <em>really</em> liked this feature, but thought being able to change others' TVs remotely was a terrible idea.

      <h1>Conclusions from User Testing</h1>
      <div class="large">
[detail on who we tested and what we asked]
      </div>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>Social TV</h1>
      <div class="large">

People want to watch TV together. They like talking about TV - they like people 
having watched the same thing as them, and older people miss the days when people were 
much more likely to have watched something they had. To get the social benefit they don't 
have to watch it at the same time as others but sometimes this is fun.

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Recommendations</h1>
      <div class="large">

People like recommendations from friends, either personally or via social networks: 
social networks here are an extension of face to face interactions; but not all 
recommendations from friends are equally good. 
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Privacy</h1>
      <div class="large">

People will trade-off privacy and personalisation, especially if they see the 
benefit. They're getting used to systems that do this, like Amazon.

      </div>
    </section>
    <section>

      <h1>What to watch</h1>
      <div class="large">

People use various means to find out what to watch, including social networks and 
word of mouth, newspapers and listings magazines, and TV adverts and TV show 
cross-promotion. They don't spend much time browsing content sites to find programmes 
to watch.

      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>TV and Second Screen UX</h1>
      <div class="large">

As TVs become more complex, interacting with them via remotes is becoming much 
harder, in particular, UX between applications is inconsistent, text input is 
difficult, and reading text is difficult. 
<br />

There are no conventions yet for tablets as first screen controls, so their behaviour is 
not well understood in this context, although in general people enjoy using tablets 
and find them intuitive.

      </div>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>Predictions from a User Perspective</h1>
      <img src="content/images/secondscreens.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

We see second screen devices (tablets and smartphone) continuing to play a major role 
in complementing TV. 
<br />
We think TVs may get dumber rather than smarter.
<br />
Interactions will be done on mobile devices/tablets which have better UX.

      </div>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>Key Technical Questions</h1>

<div class="large">What's the role of metadata in TV and in applications? 
How do devices find out about each other and communicate with each other, and how can we make the process very simple?
What are good technologies for syncing TV and other metadata, and sharing information in real time?</div>

    </section>



    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: Technical Questions</h1>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>Pairing</h1>
      <div class="large">

Probably the key issue is pairing of devices. We have tried various techniques: QR 
codes, numeric codes, autodiscovery, and numeric 'pin' encapsulating enough 
information to connect. Pin seems to be most useful, simple and best understood and least 
prone to technical problems.

us to help shape some huge changes
