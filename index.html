       <div class='large'>NoTube is a project about the Web and TV. WP7c focused on 
social media and TV, a topic that has become more popular in the lifetime of the 
project.<br /><br />

Early on we identified some <a href="">key user questions</a> and some associated <a 
href="">technological questions</a>. We chose a <a href="">strategy</a>, some <a 
href="">techniques</a>, and specific <a href="">applications</a> to explore these 
questions. Here we present a summary, including the results of <a href="">user 
testing</a> the N-Screen application and some notes on <a href="">continuity and 
longevity</a>.</div>

      <h1>Background: TV, the Web, and Attention</h1>

      <img src="content/images/cat_tv.png" width="200px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">
        There is increasing competition for attention from the Web, and TV is losing out.</li>
        <br /><em>But</em> activity data, personal data and social network data mean fewer eyeballs but more
valuable ones
        <br />
        We took a user perspective on these changes, rather than an industry one.

      </div>

<div class="notes">
Driving our work are some observations about behaviour and technology. The Web has 
been a looming presence over TV since it began to take up large proportions of 
peoples' attention. Competition for attention: for adverts, for types of content, for 
free over paid for content, and the sheer volume of content, are all reducing the 
amount of attention devoted to traditional TV.
<br />
<br />
However, by measuring and classifying usage more precisely, the technology could 
improve the quality of the attention TV does receive. The increased availability of 
activity data, personal data and social network data are all valuable resources of 
increasing the monetary value of the attention that is given: fewer eyeballs but more 
valuable ones.

     <h1>Key User Questions</h1>

      <div class="large">
General questions such as: how do people watch TV together, and why? How is this 
changing as the devices and availability of programmes change and with the rise of 
social networks? what are the technologies that might help them watch together in the 
way they want to, in the future?

      <h1>And Specifically</h1>
      <div class="large">

How people can find something to watch when faced with an overwhelming choice? what 
is the role of social recommendations to end users? what are the perceived trade-offs 
between personalisation in exchange for loss of privacy, and how is it best to interact 
with the Web and TV simultaneously?

A main UX theme of NoTube project: How do people make good decisions so they choose programmes they end up liking? promote content discovery – finding things that are interesting, even if they’re not exactly what you’re looking for. Often the user is looking for “something to watch” rather than one programme in particular. 

Discovering content rather than searching for it

N-Screen supports different recommendation and browsing strategies, including those based on Beancounter profiles, into one unified end-user interface. This provides multiple ways of helping people to find something interesting to watch, across the spectrum from fully personalised to cold-start. However, there was a need to improve the way in which the different types of recommendations are presented and related to each other.

      <h1>N-Screen functionality and User Testing</h1>
      <img src="content/images/nscreen2.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

The idea with “Suggestions for you” is that each participant starts with a different set of personalised recommendations from the video collection (based on NoTube’s user profiling service Beancounter) – recommendations are PUSHED to the user – minimal effort on their part (all they have to do is create a Beancounter account)

For testing we had to show mock-up examples of these types of suggestions, and we had to ask our participants to imagine these were based on their user profile. Despite this, all the participants liked the concept of seeing programme suggestions based on things they’d done in the past. 

However, they weren’t so keen on the idea of getting recommendations based solely on age and or gender. Several participants thought that this just wouldn’t work for them because they thought that their TV tastes didn’t match their age or gender profile, others thought that people didn’t like to be “pigeon-holed” in this way.

      <img src="content/images/nscreen3.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">
We also thought it was important from UX perspective to provide a “random selection” (or “shuffle”) option as an alternative means of surfacing content buried in the video collection, or for times when the user might reach a dead-end with the recommendations approach. It also adds an extra element of serendipity to the experience.
The idea of showing users a random selection of items to provide another route into the content was based on the findings of our user evaluation study of the NoTube Archive Browser which we conducted earlier this year. Our findings suggested that people found interesting new programmes in Redux regardless of whether they saw similar or random programmes. 
Most participants said they thought they would find this feature useful as another way of finding new programmes, and a couple of them said it was one the things they liked best about N-Screen, although we did discover a few usability issues with the user interface.

      <div class="large">

Finding interesting niche video content and sharing these ‘hidden gems’ with friends are both central components of N-Screen. We were keen to keep the drag and drop functionality to share recommendations with N-Screen friends. When we demoed early versions of N-Screen this aspect of the UX really appealed to people because it’s simple and fun to use. 
once they’d got the hang of it, the majority of our participants also enjoyed dragging and dropping to swap programme suggestions, because they found it simple, fun, and instant. 
We discovered a few initial usability issues around grabbing items to drag and dropping them in the right place, and most people didn’t realise at first that programme items could be dragged. However, it’s possible that this was because 9 out of 10 of them were not tablet owners, and were therefore not familiar with using drag-and-drop, an interaction style that is becoming increasingly common with the rise in numbers of touchscreen devices.

RECEIVING SUGGESTIONS from friends is another way of finding something interesting to watch.
The idea of sharing and receiving suggestions for things to watch with friends in this way was a highlight of the app for many.

      <div class="large">
Tapping on a programme suggestion in N-Screen displays an overlay with a brief programme synopsis, and an explanation as to why it has been recommended – for example: “Recommended because you That’s Britain also has Nick Knowles in it”. The idea is that this type of explanation presents the pathways through the Linked Data graph showing the connection that led to a recommendation being made.

One of our questions was: Does this type of explanation help to persuade people to try watching something new? – after all, one of things we want from a good recommendation system is for it to help us broaden our horizons and discover new, enjoyable things that we would probably not have discovered on our own.

However 4 of our participants didn’t seem to care as much about the explanation for a recommendation as we’d expected. It’s possible though that the explanations may have had more resonance with our participants if they’d be based on the individual’s real activities and data.

      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">
People want to watch TV together. They like talking about TV - they like people having watched the same thing as them, and older ones miss the days when people were much more likely to have watched something they had. They don't have to watch it at the same time as others but sometimes this is fun.

    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">

People like recommendations from friends, either personally or via social networks: 
social networks here are an extension of face to face interactions; but not all 
recommendations from friends are equally good. People will trade-off privacy and 
personalisation, especially if they see the benefit. They're getting used to systems 
that do this, like Amazon. 

      </div>
    </section>
    <section>

      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">
People use various means to find out what to watch, 
including social networks and word of mouth, newspapers and listings magazines, and 
TV adverts and TV show cross-promotion.

    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">

As TVs become more complex, interacting with them via remotes is becoming much 
harder, in particular, UX between applications is inconsistent, text input is 
difficult, and reading text is difficult. There are no conventions for tablets as 
first screen controls, so their behaviour is not well understood, although in general 
people enjoy using tablets and find them intuitive.

    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: User Questions</h1>
      <img src="content/images/secondscreens.png" width="400px;" align="left"/>
      <div class="large">

We still see second screen devices (tablets and smartphone) continuing to play a 
major role in complementing TV, which will remain a simpler device, for the 
forseeable future – apps not a natural part of TV viewing experience, not a fluid 
experience, not part of future TV behaviour? TV not going to get smarter (smart is in 
portable device) but dummer – interactions will be done on mobile devices/tablets – 
better UX

    <section>
      <h1>Conclusions: Technical Questions</h1>
      <div class="large">
Probably the key issue is pairing of devices. We have tried various techniques: QR codes, numeric codes, autodiscovery, and numeric 'pin' encapsulating enough information to connect seems to be most useful, simple and best understood and least prone to technical problems.
